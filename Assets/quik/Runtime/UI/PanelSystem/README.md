# Panel System

A lightweight, extensible UI Panel System packaged with **_quik._** template, designed to handle opening, closing, and transitioning between panels in an organized way.
Built with **_quik._** Signals for event handling and **DOTween** for smooth animations.

**Note:** If you plan to use this Panel System in a different project, youâ€™ll need to replace the current **_quik._** signaling system dependency with your own event/messaging implementation.
